# Good
There is no chocked chunks, great!
Graphs are pretty!
Output data management is great, as all output files are redirected to other directories.

# Might improve
A R.markdown file is missing. 
In data visualization part, didn't answer the question "Are there more SNP positions in maize or teosinte individuals?"


Thank you!
Yue
